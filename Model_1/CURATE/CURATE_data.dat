Command line used in ROBERT: python -m robert --names "Point" --y "IDT_ms" --model "[RF,GB,NN]" --csv_name "JetFuel_Ignition.csv"


o  Starting data curation with the CURATE module

o  Database JetFuel_Ignition.csv loaded successfully, including:
   - 1120 datapoints
   - 8 accepted descriptors
   - 1 ignored descriptors
   - 0 discarded descriptors

o  Analyzing categorical variables
   - No categorical variables were found

o  Duplication filters activated
   Excluded datapoints:
   -  No datapoints were removed

x  WARNING! The number of descriptors (8) is 25 times lower than the number of datapoints (1120), the correlation filters are loosen to thres_x = 0.95 and thres_y = 0.0001! Default thresholds (0.9 and 0.001) can be used with "--desc_thres False"
o  Correlation filter activated with these thresholds: thres_x = 0.95, thres_y = 0.0001
   Excluded descriptors:
   - X_Ar: R**2 = 0.97 with X_N2
   - X_He: error in R**2 with the IDT_ms values (are all the values the same?)

o  8 columns remaining after applying duplicate, correlation filters and RFECV:
   - Point
   - IDT_ms
   - X_Fuel
   - X_O2
   - X_N2
   - P
   - T
   - PHI

o  The Pearson heatmap was stored in CURATE/Pearson_heatmap.png.

o  The curated database was stored in CURATE/JetFuel_Ignition_CURATE.csv.

Time CURATE: 1.15 seconds
